                The University of Edinburgh (Scots: University o Edinburgh, Scottish 
                Gaelic: Oilthigh Dhùn Èideann; abbreviated as Edin. in post-nominals) 
                is a public research university in Edinburgh, Scotland. Granted a royal 
                charter by King James VI in 1582 and officially opened in 1583, it is 
                one of Scotland's four ancient universities and the sixth-oldest 
                university in continuous operation in the English-speaking world. The 
                university played an important role in Edinburgh becoming a chief 
                intellectual centre during the Scottish Enlightenment and contributed 
                to the city being nicknamed the "Athens of the North".
